# pokeldn

pokeldn is an implementation of Nintendo Switch local wireless (LDN) that speaks to Pokemon games
running on retail Switch hardware, through an ESP32 board on USB serial as its radio. These pages document the protocols involved, with
decompilation citations, disassembly addresses and hardware measurements.

Installation, the command-line reference and the code layout are in the
[repository README](https://github.com/Decryptu/pokeldn#readme).

## Targets

Seven games, all on retail hardware, all over the same LDN and Pia layers:

| | FRLG | LGPE | SwSh | BDSP | PLA | SV | PLZA |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Trade | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mystery Gift | ✓ | ∅ | ✓ | ∅ | ∅ | ∅ | ∅ |
| Link battle | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ∅ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Code on the console, save read and write | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

✓ works on a retail console · ✗ not done · ∅ the game has no such feature over local wireless
FRLG FireRed/LeafGreen · LGPE Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee · SwSh Sword/Shield · BDSP Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl · PLA Legends Arceus · SV Scarlet/Violet · PLZA Legends Z-A

FireRed and LeafGreen run as the original GBA ROM inside an emulator on the Switch, so the ROM's
own GBA link protocol is stacked on the console's LDN and Pia. The six other games put their own
code directly on Pia: Unity/IL2CPP in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, C++ with protocol
buffers over `gflnet3` in Sword and Shield and in Let's Go, and C++ with Pia statically linked in
Legends Arceus, in Scarlet and Violet and in Legends Z-A.

| [Legends Arceus](pla.md) | Pia header version 11, the trade flow, and the record a host composes. |
| [Scarlet and Violet](sv.md) | Pia header version 11, the reliable streams, the trade a host runs, and Tera Raids in both roles. |
| [Legends Z-A](za.md) | Pia header version 16, the game's twenty trade messages, and the trade in both roles. |
